  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>CSS Pseudo class selector</h1> <br><br><br>
    <span class="code">Pseudo class</span> is used to define a special state of an element, it can be used to : <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Style an element when a user put the mouse cursor over it</li>
      <li>Style visited and unvisited links differently</li>
      <li>Style an element when it gets focus</li>
    </ol> <br> <br>

    <span class="code">Pseudo class</span> elements are added to the selectors using (:) symbol <br>
    <span class="code">Pseudo class</span> selectors allow us to apply styles to HTML elements based on their current status or their special properties <br>
    When <span class="code">Pseudo class</span> selectors are applied to an HTML element they will have different status during run time for e.g, <br>
    <span class="code">anchor element</span> will have visited state, link state, hover state <br>
    <span class="code">input element</span> will have enabled state, disabled state, required state, checked state etc <br> <br>
    HTML elements will also have different properties in the DOM tree for e.g, <br>
    <span class="code">:first-child</span> or <span class="code">last-child</span>, <span class="code">first-of-type</span>, <span class="code">last-of-type</span> etc <br><br>

    Pseudo class selectors are divided into multiple groups depending upon their usage and they are :
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Pseudo class navigation</li>
      <li>Pseudo class user interface (UI) "form controls"</li>
      <li>Pseudo class structure (DOM)</li>
      <li>nth pseudo class</li>
    </ol>
    <br> <br>
    <span class="heading2"><strong>pseudo class navigation</strong></span> <br>
      pseudo class navigation is used to manipulate the behaviour of the hyperlinks on a webpage, they are link related pseudo-class selectors.<br>
      To style links appropriately, put the <span class="code">:visited</span> rule after the <span class="code">:link</span> rule but before the <span class="code">:hover</span> and <span class="code">:active</span> rule as defined by the (LVHA order) i.e, <span class="code">:link</span> - <span class="code">:visited</span> - <span class="code">:hover</span> -<span class="code">:active</span> (To remember the format easily we can call it "Love - hate rule" (LVHA)) <br> <br>
      pseudo class navigation has different property functions which come handy in different situation, they are: <br>
      <ol>
        <li>:link</li>
        <li>:visited</li>
        <li>:hover</li>
        <li>:active</li>
        <li>target</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <span class="heading3">:link</span> <br>
       We use <span class="code">:link</span> pseudo class to target all anchor tags which have yet to be clicked on, in other words it selects all unvisited links on a webpage. <br>
       <i>Syntax</i>:
       <pre>
         a:link {
           color:red;
         }
       </pre>
      <br><br>
      <span class="heading3">:visited</span> <br>
      We use <span class="code">:visited</span> pseudo class to apply specific styling to only the anchor tags on a webpage which have been clicked on or visited already <br>
      <i>Syntax</i>: <br>
      <pre>
        a:visited{
          color:green;
        }
      </pre> <br> <br>
      <span class="heading3">:hover</span> <br>
      It is normally triggered when a user hover over an element with a cursor (mouse pointer) <br>
      <i>Syntax</i>: <br>
      <pre>
        a:hover{
          border-bottom: 1px solid black;
        }
      </pre> <br> <br>
      <span class="heading3">:active</span> <br>
      An <span class="code">:active</span> pseudo class applies while an element is being activated by a user i.e, when a user presses the mouse button and releases it. <br>
      In other words it selects a link while it is activated i.e, being clicked or the state of the button is pressed <br>
      <i>Syntax</i>: <br>
      <pre>
        a:active {
          background-color:yellow;
        }
      </pre> <br><br>
      <span class="heading3">:target</span> <br>
      The <span class="code">:target</span> pseudo class represents a unique element (the target element) with an id matching the URL's fragment (the URL's fragment is denoted by # followed by the targeted element) <br>
      <i>Syntax</i>:
      <pre>
        a:target{
          background-color:red;
        }
      </pre> <br><br>
      <span class="heading2"><strong>Pseudo class User Interface (UI) (form controls)</strong> </span> <br>
      It manipulates the behaviour of the form control in order to assign different styling properties, input (form) related pseudo class selectors <br> <br>
      The CSS properties associated with form controls are : <br>
      <ol>
        <li>:focus</li>
        <li>:enabled</li>
        <li>:disabled</li>
        <li>:checked</li>
        <li>:required</li>
        <li>:optional</li>
        <li>:invalid</li>
        <li>:valid</li>
      </ol>
      <br><br>
      <span class="heading3">:focus</span> <br>
      As we know that "autofocus" attribute is used to highlight a particular form field or to attract user's attention by blinking cursor in a particular form field section, apart from that it is also helpful for people who use keyboard navigation to get to a particular form section so it highlights and user will know which section of the form he is on. <br>
      <i>syntax example</i>: <br>
      <pre>
        input:focus{
          color:blue;
        }
      </pre>
      <br><br>
      <span class="heading3">:enabled</span> <br>
      It selects inputs that are in the default state of <span class="code">enabled</span> and ready to be used. <br>
      By default all the form fiends are <span class="code">enabled</span> unless they are disabled by using <span class="code">disabled</span> attribute, it targets all the (enabled) form fields, to make it more specific for a particular email field we can use an attribute name and value eg.,<br>
      <br>
      <pre>
        input[type="email"]:enabled{
         background-color:blue;
        }
        or
        input:enabled{
          color:green;
        }
      </pre>
      <br><br>
      <span class="heading3">:disabled</span> <br>
      As we know that in order to make a form field <span class="code">disabled</span> which means the form field will be grayed out and a user will not be able to use it to fill any detail, so using <span class="code">disabled</span> property we can style the <span class=code"">disabled</span> form field. <br>
      <br>
      <i>Syntax and example</i> <br>
      <pre>
        input:disabled{
          color:gray;
        }
      </pre>
      <span class="heading3">:checked</span> <br>
      It selects checkboxes what are selected or checked <br>
      <span class="code">:checked</span> property is used to style the radio buttons and the checkboxes where we have multiple options available and it works on the principle of adjacent sibling selector (+). <br>
      <i>Syntax and example </i> <br>
      <pre>
        input:checked+label{
          background-color:red;
        }
      </pre>
      <span class="heading3">:required</span> <br>
      It selects inputs with the <span class="code">required</span> attribute. <br>
      <span class="code"> required </span> property is used in order to make sure that a user while filling up the form details also fill up the particular form field which we have marked as <span class="code">required</span> and the form cannot be submitted without filling up the required form section and in order to style the required section in the form field we use <span class="code">:required</span> property. <br>
      <i>Syntax or Example</i>: <br>
      <pre>
        input:required{
          background-color:purple;
        }
      </pre>
      <span class="heading3">:optional</span> <br>
      It selects inputs that do not have the <span class="code">required</span> attribute. <br>
      <span class="code">optional</span> attribute is opposite to <span class="code">required</span> attribute, which means that if we have not assigned any <span class="code">required</span> attribute for a form field so for all the form field section it will be considered as <span class="code">optional</span> and the style will be applied accordingly. <br>
      <i>Syntax and Example</i>: <br>
      <pre>
        input:optional{
          background-color:red;
        }
      </pre>
      <span class="heading3">:invalid</span> <br>
      The <span class="code">:invalid</span> CSS pseudo-class represents any <span class="code">&lt;input&gt;</span> or other <span class="code"> &lt;form&gt; </span> elements whose content fails to validate. <br>
      As we know that recently in HTML5 there have been centain attributes added which helps to validate the values entered in the form and in order to highlight the invalid entries made in the form we can use the <span class="code">:invalid</span> attribute <br>
      <i>Syntax and Example</i>: <br>
      <pre>
        input:invalid{
          background-color:pink;
        }
      </pre>
      <span class="heading3">:valid</span> <br>
      The <span class="code">:valid</span> CSS pseudo-class represents any <span class="code">&lt;input&gt;</span> and <span class="code">&lt;form&gt;</span> elements whose content validates successfully. It is usefull for highlighting correct fields for the user, unless if we enter an invalid entry in the form field it will keep all the form field sections in the <span class="code">valid</span> state. <br>
      <i>Syntax and example</i>:
      <pre>
        input:valid{
          background-color:blue;
        }
      </pre>
      <br>
      <span class="heading2"> Pseudo class structure (DOM)</span>
      They are the position based pseudo class selector with in the DOM tree.Its also called as structured pseudo class selectors. <br>
      Structured pseudo class selectors meaning it is used to style content based on its relationship with parent and sibling selector <br>
      In total there are 8 properties associated with Pseudo class structure and they are: <br>
      <ol>
        <li>:root</li>
        <li>:empty</li>
        <li>:first-child</li>
        <li>:last-child</li>
        <li>:only-child</li>
        <li>first-of-type</li>
        <li>last-of-type</li>
        <li>only-of-type</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <span class="heading4">:root</span> <br>
      The <span class="code">:root</span> selector matches the document's root element, In HTML, the root element is always the html element. <br>
      It targets the root element which is always the opening and closing of &lt;html&gt; and &lt/html&gt; tag which is by default the root selector for all HTML elements and it is used to apply styles collectively. <br>
      <pre>
        :root{
          background-color:pink;
          color:white;
        }
      </pre>
      <span class="heading4">:empty</span> <br>
      The <span class="code">:empty</span> selector matches every element that has no children (including text contents), <br>
      It selects every HTML elements targeted by the selector if the elements has no content it will style that element. <br>
      <i>Syntax and example</i>; <br>
      <pre>
        p:empty{
          border: 2px solid red;
        }
      </pre>
      <span class="heading4">:first-child</span> <br>
      <span class="code">:first-child</span> selector is used to select the first child of its parent element. if the condition meets say for example we have a parent element &lt;div&gt; tag and with in &lt;div&gt; tag we have h1 then h2 and then p tag so if we want to target any p tag if its the first child of the parent element (&lt;div&gt;) so the style should be applied on it but as we know the first child is h1 and p is the third child so the condition is not going to fulfil and style will not be applied <br>
      <i>Syntax and Example</i> <br>
      <pre>
        p:first-child{
          background-color:pink
        }
      </pre>
      <span class="heading4">:last-child</span> <br>
      <span class="code">:last-child</span>  selector is used to select the last child of its parent element. It the condition meets for the last child it applied the style and if the condition doesn't meet then the style will not be applied. <br>
      <i>Syntax and example</i>: <br>
      <pre>
        h1:last-child{
          border: 2px solid green;
        }
      </pre>
      <span class="heading4">:only-child</span>: <br>
      <span class="code">only-child</span> selector is used to select the only child of its parent element, say for example we have two &lt;p&gt; tags with in a div1 element and within div2 element there is only one &lt;p&gt; tags so the condition will be met with div2 element as it has only 1 child element which is &lt;p&gt; tag. <br>
      <i>Syntax and example</i>: <br>
      <pre>
        p:only-child{
          border: 2px solid red;
        }
      </pre>
      <span class="heading4">:only-of-type</span>: <br>
      The differemce in between <span class="code">:only-child</span> selector and <span class="code">only-of-type</span> selector is that in <span class="code">only-child</span> selector if in parent element say we have  &lt;div1&gt; tag we have 3 &lt;p&gt; tags element so it doesn't fulfil the condition there has to be only one &lt;p&gt; tag as a child element similarly for <span class="code">only-of-type</span> selector if there is one &lt;div2&gt; tag and it has 3 &lt;p&gt; tags and one &lt;h1&gt;  tags so it will fulful the condition since apart from 3 &lt;p&gt; tags there was one &lt;h1&gt; tag is there and that's the <span class="code">:only-of-type</span> selector which will be styled <br>
      <i>syntax and example</i>: <br>
      <pre>
        h1:only-of-type {
          border: 3px dotted green;
        }
      </pre>
      <span class="heading4">:first-of-type</span>: <br>
      <span class="code">:first-of-type</span> selector will target the first of its kind regardless of if the are more then one of the same elements or if there is a different element above the targeted element as long as its the first of its type it will be styled <br>
      The difference in between <span class="code">first-child</span> selector and the <span class="code">first-of-type</span> selector selector is that in <span class="code">first-child</span> selector if we have 1 &lt;h1&gt; tag above 3 &lt;p&gt; and we want to target <span class="code">first-child</span> selector for &lt;p&gt; tag so it will not fulfil the condition since we have &lt;h1&gt; above &lt;p&gt; tag however in case of <span class="code">first-of-type</span> selector it doesn't matter it will still style the &lt;p&gt; tag the one which is just below the &lt;h1&gt; because that's the first &lt;p&gt; tag of its parent element.
      <i>Syntax and example</i>: <br>
      <pre>
        p:first-of-type{
          background-color:blue;
        }
      </pre>
      <span class="heading4">:last-of-type</span>: <br>
      <span class="code">:last-of-type</span> selector works just as <span class="code">first-of-type</span> selector but the only difference is as the name suggest <span class="code">last-of-type</span> selector so it selects any HTML element targeted by the selector if it is the last-child of its type in its parent HTML element <br>
      <i>Example</i>: <br>
      <pre>
        p:last-of-type{
          background-color:green;
        }
      </pre>
      <br>
      <span class="heading2">nth pseudo class</span> <br>
      Its a number based pseudo class selectors <br>
      There are 6 pseudo class selectors that we use in nth pseudo class selectors and they are : <br>
      <ol>
        <li>:nth-child()</li>
        <li>:nth-last-child()</li>
        <li>:nth-of-type()</li>
        <li>:nth-last-of-type()</li>
        <li>:not()</li>
        <li>:lang()</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <u>Syntax</u>: <br>
      <pre>
        :nth-child(argument){
          CSS property value;
        }
      </pre>
      <br> <br>

      <span class="heading5">:nth-child(n)</span> <br>
      It functions just like the <span class="code">first-child</span>, As we know that if we have to target the first child element of its parent element we can use <span class="code">:first-child</span> selector similarly if we want to target last child of its parent element so we can use <span class="code">:last-child</span> selector but what if we want to target the second child or the third child or the fourth child so in that case we use <span class="code">:nth-child(n)</span> selector. <br> <br>
      The <span class="code">:nth-child(n)</span> selector matches elements based on their position in a group of siblings, <br>
      Here, "n" could be a number, keyword or a formula wherein, <br>
      number could be anywhere starting from 1 <br>
      keyword could be either even or odd <br>
      formula would be a mathematical formula that is (an+b) <br>
      <br>
      <i>Example</i>: <br>
      <pre>
        p:nth-child(3){
          border: 2px solid green;
        }
      </pre>
      If we have multiple &lt;div&gt; tag eg, div1, div2 and div3 and we only want to target &lt;p&gt; tags from div1 and not div2 and div3 so in that case we can write it like this, : <br>
      <pre>
        div1 p:nth-child(3){
          border: 2px solid green
        }
      </pre>

      <span class="heading5">nth-child(even/odd)</span><br>
      It is entirely different from the <span class="code">:first-child</span> or the <span class="code">first-of-type</span> as It allows us to target multiple elements and apply style on them according to their position as child element with in the parent element, using keywords, it allows us to target all children element which are placed at the even position with in the parent element, similarly, it allows us to target all children element which are placed at the odd position with in the parent element. <br>
      <u>Example for even</u>:
      <pre>
        p:nth-child(even){
          border: 2px solid blue;
        }
      </pre>
      <u>Example for odd</u>:
      <pre>
        p:nth-child(odd){
          border: 2px solid green;
        }
      </pre>

      <span class="heading5">nth-child(an+b)</span> <br>
      It selects any HTML element targeted by the selector if its the (an+b)<sup>th</sup> child element in its parent html element. <br>
      where, the mathamatical formula (an+b):  <br>
      a represents a cycle size, which is an integer (default is 1) <br>
      n represents counter or incremental value (starts at 0), <br>
      b represents offset value, which is an integer (default is 0) <br>
      So basis the default value the formula represents: <br>
      <pre>
        <strong>:nth-child(1*n+0)</strong>
         which is equivalent to
        <strong>:nth-child(n) </strong>
      </pre>
      In order to calculate the values for the formula (an+b) <br> <br>

      :nth-child(1n+0) <br>
      Let's take the value of a = 1, n = 0 and b = 0 <br>
      (1n+0) = 1 * 0 + 0 = 0 <br>
      (1n+0) = 1 * 1 + 0 = 1 <br>
      (1n+0) = 1 * 2 + 0 = 2 <br>
      (1n+0) = 1 * 3 + 0 = 3 <br> <br>

      <strong>So it will target all the child element since it is incremented by 1</strong> <br> <br>

      Similarly if we are to calculate (2n+0) so as per the formula <br> <br>

      :nth-child(2n+0) <br>
      The value will become a = 2, n = 0 (incremented) and b = 0 <br>
      (2n+0) = 2 * 0 + 0 = 0 <br>
      (2n+0) = 2 * 1 + 0 = 2 <br>
      (2n+0) = 2 * 2 + 0 = 4 <br>
      (2n+0) = 2 * 3 + 0 = 6 <br> <br>

      <strong>      So it will target all the even positioned children </strong> <br> <br>

      <u>Syntax</u>: <br>
      <pre>
        p:nth-child(2n+1){
          border: 2x solid purple;
        }
      </pre>
      It will target all children element if they are at (2n+1)<sup>th</sup> positioned in the parent element which is basically the odd positions with in the parent element<br>

      <br>
      <span class="heading5">:nth-last-child()</span> <br>
      It helps us target an HTML element which we can target from the bottom or the last, the <span class="code">:nth-last-child(n)</span> selector matches every element that is the nth child, regardless of type, of its parent, counting from the last child <br>
      In other words the <span class="code">:nth-last-child</span> selector matches elements based on their position among a group of siblings, counting from the end. <br>
      <u>Example</u>: <br>
      <pre>
        p:nth-last-child(3){
            border: 2px solid green;
        }
        It targets any HTML element if its the 3rd last child of its parent element. <br>
      </pre>
      <span class="heading5">:nth-of-type()</span> <br>
      The <span class="code">:nth-of-type</span> selector is similar to <span class="code">:first-of-type</span> selector since it works in the same manner for example if we have 2 &lt;div&gt; tags which are &lt;div1&gt; tag and &lt;div2&gt; tag and in &lt;div1&gt; tag we have &lt;h2&gt; tag followed by 3 &lt;p&gt; tags now if we want to style 2nd &lt;p&gt; tags so we can use <span class="code">:nth-of-type</span> selector to style the particular element. <br>
      <u>Syntax</u>: <br>
      <pre>
        :nth-of-type(){
          CSS declaration
        }
      </pre>


        When we pass a number to (n) pseudo class, a pseudo class selector will target a single element from its parent HTML element. <br>
        <u>Example</u>:
          p:nth-of-child(3){
            border: 2px solid blue;
          }

        if we want to target more than one element or multiple elements so in that case we can use a keyword (even/odd) . <br>
        <u>Example</u>:
        p:nth-of-type(even){
          border: 2px solid green;
        }

      <pre>
        p:nth-of-type{
          border: 2px solid blue;
        }
      </pre>
      <span class="heading5">nth-last-of-type()</span>
      The <span class="code">:nth-last-of-type</span> selector works just the way as <span class="code">:nth-of-type</span> selector works but the only difference is <span class="code">:nth-last-of-type</span> selector start counting from the bottom. <br>
      <u>Example</u>:
      <pre>
        p:nth-last-of-type{
          border: 2px dotted purple;
        }
      </pre>
      <br>
      <span class="heading5">:not()</span> <br>
      The <span class="code">:not()</span> selector is also known as <span class="code">negation pseudo class</span> selector, <br>
      The negation pseudo class selector represents elements that do not match a list of selectors. Since it prevents specific items or selectors being selected, it is also known as negation pseudo class. <br>
      <u>Example</u>: <br>
    <pre>
      :not(p){
        background-color:blue;
      }
      It means set a background color for all the element that are not a &lt;p&gt; tag
    </pre>
    <span class="heading5">:lang()</span> <br>
    The <span class="code">:lang()</span> selector matches elements based on the language they are determined to be in. <br>
    It is also known as <span class="code">language pseudo class</span> selector, it helps us to select any HTML element targeted by the selector, if it has the lang attribute value set to the specified language code. <br>
    We can find the two letter language code by searching ISO language code on a web browser. <br>
    <u>Syntax</u>:<br>
    <pre>
      selector:lang(ISO language code){
        background-color:yellow;
      }
    </pre>
    <u>Example</u>:
    <pre>
      p:lang(en){
        background-color:yellow
      }
    </pre>

  </body>

</html>
