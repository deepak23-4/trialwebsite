    <h1>Git and Github</h1> <br> <br><br>
    <span class="heading3"> What is Git </span> ?   <br>
    A Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. <br> <br>

    First developed back in 2005, Git is an extremely popular version control system because its responsive, easy to use and inexpensive (actually free). <br>
    One thing that really sets Git apart is its branching model. <span class="code">branching</span> allows you to create independent local branches in your code, which means you can try out new ideas, set aside branches for production work, jump back to earlier branches and easily <span class="code">delete</span>, <span class="code">merge</span> and <span class="code">recall</span> branches at a click of a button. <br>
    Git is installed on your local computer (rather than in the cloud) and gives you a self contained record of your ongoing programming version. <br><br><br>

    <span class="heading3"> What is GitHub </span>?  <br>
    A GitHub is a cloud based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. <br> <br>
    <span class="code">GitHub</span> is designed as a Git repository hosting service, which means its an online (cloud-based) database that allows you to keep track of and share your Git version control project outside of your local computer/server. <br>
    unlike <span class="code">Git</span>, <span class="code">GitHub</span> is exclusive cloud-based and for-profit service (although basic repository-hosting feature are available at no cost to those who are willing to create a user profile, making <span class="code">GitHub</span> a popular choice for open-source projects).<br>
    Since <span class="code">GitHub</span> is cloud-based, an individual's Git repositories can be remotely accessed by any authorized person, from any computer, anywhere in the world using internet connection. <br>
    Through <span class="code">GitHub</span>, you can share your project with others, giving them the power to make revisions or edits on your various <span class="code">Git</span> branches, which makes it possible for entire team to co-ordinate together on a single project in real time, As changes are introduced, new branches are created, allowing the team to continue to revise the code without overwritting each other's work. These branches are like copies, changes made on them do not reflect in the main directoies on other users' machine unless users choose to push/pull the changes to incorporate them. <br><br>

    Both <span class="code">Git</span> and <span class="code">GitHub</span> give programmers valueable version-control functionality so that they can build ongoing coding projects without being afraid of messing everything up <br> <br> <br>

    <span class="heading3">What is Version control system </span>? <br>
    A <span class="code">Version control system</span> also called as <span class="code">source control system</span> and <span class="code">Revision control system</span>, it allows developers to collaborate on code and track changes. Version control is an essential tool for multiple developer projects. <br> <br>
    <span class="code">Version control system</span> is a catagory of processes and tools designed to keep track of multiple/ different versions of software, content, documents, websites and other information in development. Any system that provides change tracking and control over programming source code and documentation can be considered as <span class="code">Version control software</span> <br><br>
    <span class="code">Revision control system</span> allows users for the ability to revert a document to a previous version, which is critical for allowing editor to track each other's edits, correct mistakes <br><br><br>

    <span class="heading3">What is the purpose of version control </span> : <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Multiple people can work simultaneously on a single project, everyone works on and edits their own copy of the files and it is upto them when they wish to share the changes made by them with the rest of the team.</li>
      <li>It also enables to one person to use multiple computer to work on a project so it is valueable even if you are working by yourself</li>
      <li>It integrates the work that is done simultaneously by different members of the team. In some rare case, when conflicting edits are made by two people to the same line of a file, then human assistance is requested by the version control system in deciding what should be done.</li>
      <li>Version control provides the access to the historical versions of a project. This is insurance against computer crashes or data loss. If any mistake is made, you can easily roll back to a previous version. It is also possible to undo specific edits that too without losing the work done in the meanwhile. It can be easily knowm when, why and by whom any part of a file was edited. </li>
    </ol>

    <span class="heading3"> What are the types of Version Control Systems</span> ? <br>
    There are two main catagories of <span class="code">Version Control Systems</span>, they are : <br> <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Centralized Version Control</li>
      <li>Decentralized (Distributed) Version Control</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <dl>
      <dt><span class="heading4">Centralized Version Control</span></dt>
      <dd>It works on a "Client-server relationship" model, The server is the master repository which contains all the versions of the code. To work on any project, firstly an end-user or a client needs to get the code from the master repository or the server. So the client communicates with the server and pulls all the document file or current version of the code from the server on to the local computer. Once you get the latest version of the code or the local copy from the master repository,  you start making your own changes in the code and after that, you simply need to commit those change back into the master repository. <br>
      <u>Committing a change simply means merging your own code back into the master repository or making a new version off the source code</u>. So everything is centralized in this model. <br> <br>
      The repository is located at one place and provides access to many clients. Its very similar to FTP, where you have an FTP client which connects to an FTP server. All changes, users, commits and imformation must be sent and received from this central repository. The popular version control system is known as "subversion" <br> <br>

      <strong>The benefits of Subversion are</strong>: <br>
      <ol>
        <li>Its easy to understand</li>
        <li>You have more control over users and access (since it is served from one place)</li>
        <li>More GUI and IDE clients (subversion has been around longer)</li>
        <li>Simple to get started</li>
      </ol>  <br>
        <strong>The drawbacks of Subversion are</strong>: <br>
        <ol>
          <li>Dependent on access to the server</li>
          <li>Hard to manage server and back-up (except for Beanstalk)</li>
          <li>It can be slower because every command connects to the server</li>
          <li>Branching and merging tools are difficult to use</li>
        </ol>
       </dd> <br><br>

       <dt> <span class="heading4">Distributed Version Control</span> </dt>
       <dd>The major difference that you get with <span class="code">Distributed Version Control</span> is, instead of one single repository which is the server, here every single developer or client has their own server and they will have the copy of the entire history or version of the code and all of its branches in their local server or machine. <strong>Basically every client or user can work locally and disconnected which is more convenient then centralized source control and that's why it is called <span class="code">distributed version control</span></strong></dd> <br>Think of it as a network of individual repositories. The two most popular distributed version control systems are <span class="code">Git</span> and <span class="code">Mercurial</span>.</dl> <br>
       <strong>The primary benefits of Git and Mercurial are: </strong> <br>
        <ol>
          <li>More powerful and detailed change tracking, which means less conflicts.</li>
          <li>No server necessary - all actions except sharing repositories are local (commit offline)</li>
          <li>Branching and merging is more reliable, and therefore used more often</li>
          <li>Its fast</li>
        </ol> <br> <br>
        <strong>The drawbacks associated with Git and Mercurial are</strong>: <br>
        <ol>
          <li>The distributed model is harder to understand</li>
          <li>It's new so not so many GUI clients</li>
          <li>The revisions are not incremental numbers, which makes them harder to reference</li>
          <li>It can be easier to make mistakes untill you are familiar with the model</li>
        </ol>
        <br><br>
      <span class="heading2">Terms to remember while using Git</span> <br>
        <ol>
          <li>Directory : Folder on our computer</li>
          <li>Terminal or command line : Interface for text command</li>
          <li>CLI : Command line interface </li>
          <li>cd : Change Directory</li>
          <li>code editor : Word processor for Writing code (IDE)</li>
          <li>Repository : Project or the folder (place where your project is kept)</li>
          <li>Github : A website to host your repositories online</li>
          <li>Git : a tool that tracks the changes in your code overtime</li>
        </ol> <br> <br>
        <span class="heading2">Git commands which we need to learn as we are going to use them while using Git</span> <br>
        <strong>All these commands are to be used in lowercase character while using on Git</strong> <br> <br>
        <ol>
          <li><u>Clone</u> : Brings a repository that is hosted somewhere like GitHub into a folder on your local machine</li>
          <li><u>Add</u> : Track your files and changes in Git (e.g. when we have updated files or created or deleted files and folders your are gonna want to tell Git that you have made changes and you would like Git to track those changes.)</li>
          <li><u>Commit</u> : Save your files in Git (e.g. It is used to save the changes you make in your code)</li>
          <li><u>Push</u> : Upload Git commits to a remote repo, like GitHub (e.g, Once we have made changes locally on our computer and we are ready to put them in Git, we tell Git to track them through the add command, we save our files to get through the commit command and then we upload the files to a place like GitHub or another remote repository like bitbucket, GitLab etc. we do this through the push command)</li>
          <li><u>Pull</u> : Download changes from remote repo to your local machine, the opposite of push (e.g, When there are changes made to your code on GitHub and you want to bring those to your local computer machine then you use the pull command, you pull down changes from remote repository to local computer.)</li>
        </ol>
