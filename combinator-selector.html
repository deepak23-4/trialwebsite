    <h1>Combinator selector</h1> <br><br><br>
    <br>
    They are called combinator selectors because they combine other selectors in a way that gives them a useful relationship to each other and the location of content in the document. <br> <br>
    <span class="heading2">There are four different types of combinator selectors, they are: </span> <br><br>
    <ol>
      <li>Descendant selector</li>
      <li>Child selector</li>
      <li>Adjacent sibling selector</li>
      <li>General sibling selector</li>
    </ol>
    <br> <br>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>descendant selector</strong> </dt>
      <dd>It is represented by a single space <span class="code">(&nbsp)</span> between two selectors without a combinator <br>
        Descendant means anywhere nested within the web document in a DOM tree, it could be a direct child, could be five levels deep, its still a descendant. <br>
        We can combine two or more than 2 tags from generic to specific <br> </dd>
        <i>Example</i>:
        <pre>
          ul li{color:red;}

          it means "any list item that has a descendant of any unordered list will have a font color red" and it will have a font color "red" for all the list items under unordered list. <br>
        </pre>
        <br> <br>
        <dt><strong>child selector</strong> </dt>
        <dd>A child selector is represented by greater than sign <span class="code">(>)</span> which is placed in between two CSS selectors <br>
        It targets only those elements which are the direct child of its parents element in other words it targets those elements which are direct descendants only</dd>
        The only different in between descendant selector ol li{ } and child selector ol>li{ } is that in descendant selector it will target the direct child, child's child and it will go further down with in the same hierarchy to all its descendants however in child selector it will only target the child selector which is the direct descendant. <br>
        </dd>
        <i>Exammple</i>:
        <pre>
          ul>li{
            color:blue;
          }

          it means as direct child if it has 5 list items so all will be selected however if its nested list with in the unordered list so it will not select the further down level. <br>
        </pre>
        <br><br>
        <dt><strong>Adjacent sibling selector</strong> </dt>
        <dd>The adjacent sibling combinator selector is represented by <span class="code">(+)</span> character sign and it allows you to target an element that is directly after the specific element. <br>
        adjacent sibling selectors can only be applied to the elements of the same parent</dd> <br>
        <i>Example</i>:
        <pre>
          img + p {
            font-weight:bold}
          }
          it means here the paragraph which comes directly after img tag will have bold fonts weight.
        </pre>
        <br><br>
        <dt><strong>general sibling selector</strong> </dt>
        general sibling selector is represented by (~) character
        The general sibling selector is very similar to the adjacent sibling selector, the difference is that that the element being selected doesn't need to immediately succeed the first element, it can appear anywhere after it within the same parent element. <br>
    </dl>
        <i>Syntax</i>: <br>
        <pre>
          p~p{color:blue; }
        </pre>


  </body>
</html>
